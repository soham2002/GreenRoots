            <p>The primary study area is situated in the southernmost coastal region of the Indian state of West Bengal,
                adjacent to the largest delta, the Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta. The Sundarbans, positioned between 21° 432′ –
                21° 55′ N latitude and 88° 42′ – 89° 04′ E longitude, spans an area of 133,010 hectares (513.6 sq mi).
                The population in this region is estimated to be between 125-130 million.

                The temperature in this locale exhibits a range of 20°C to 48°C, experiencing heavy rainfall with high
                moisture content during the monsoon season. The Sundarbans are characterized by a complex network of seven
                main rivers, various channels, and estuaries that culminate in the delta.

                The nomenclature "Sundarbans" finds its origins in the name of a native plant known as the "Sundari"
                tree, a distinctive type of mangrove equipped with pneumatophores facilitating respiration. Home to a
                population of almost more than 400 tigers, the Sundarbans serves as a protected reserve forest, ensuring
                the conservation of these majestic creatures. In recognition of its ecological significance, the
                Sundarbans was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1987 and was also incorporated into the Ramsar
                Wetland List in January 2019.

            <h2>Satellite Monitoring</h2> <br>
            <p>Satellite imagery has emerged as a pivotal resource for the remote monitoring of mangroves on a global
                scale. This approach has witnessed an increasing adoption in recent years, marked by numerous ongoing
                and advanced initiatives. The present project illuminates several such endeavors.

                Google Earth Engine (GEE) stands out as a formidable tool, offering unfettered access to an extensive
                repository of satellite imagery. Leveraging Landsat 7 satellite data and cutting-edge technology, we
                employ the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). By scrutinizing the near-infrared and visible
                light reflected by vegetation, NDVI yields vital insights into plant vigor, biomass, and overall
                ecosystem health.

                This robust tool empowers us to systematically track alterations in vegetation cover, pinpoint areas
                experiencing stress or degradation, and facilitate informed decision-making for sustainable land
                management and conservation endeavors. The utilization of Google Earth Engine, coupled with NDVI
                analysis, exemplifies a sophisticated and effective approach towards harnessing satellite technology
                for the greater understanding and preservation of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

            <h2>Introduction to our Model</h2>
            <p>At the core of our AI model lies an intricate neural network, meticulously trained on an extensive
                dataset encompassing years of satellite imagery and ground observations. This neural network functions
                as a virtual detective, leveraging its learned knowledge to meticulously scrutinize vast expanses of
                imagery and discern intricate patterns and anomalies. Through this sophisticated analysis, our AI model
                plays a pivotal role in uncovering nuanced insights within the data.

                The neural network is designed to investigate and interpret various spectral bands and indices, with a
                particular emphasis on tools such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI, a key
                spectral index derived from satellite data, proves instrumental in quantifying the health and density
                of vegetation. By comparing the reflectance of near-infrared and visible light, the AI model can
                effectively identify changes in vegetation cover, fluctuations in water levels, and alterations in land
                use dynamics over distinct periods of time.

                This technology not only enables us to monitor the Earth's surface comprehensively but also provides
                a powerful means to detect subtle variations that may elude traditional methods. The AI model's
                proficiency in understanding complex relationships within satellite imagery contributes to a more
                profound comprehension of environmental changes, facilitating informed decision-making for a range of
                applications, from ecological monitoring to sustainable land management..
